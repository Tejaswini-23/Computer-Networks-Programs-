# 🌐 Computer Networks Problem Set (Java)

This repository contains a collection of problems and simulations I implemented as part of my **Computer Networks** learning journey. Each folder contains code written in **Java**, and is organized by protocol, algorithm, or concept for clarity.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
.

├───ByteStuff             # Byte stuffing technique
├───Commands              # Basic CN-related terminal/CLI command simulations
├───CRC                   # Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) implementation
├───Dijkstras             # Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path in networks
├───Distance Vector       # Distance Vector Routing Protocol simulation
├───Files                 # File transfer simulations
├───LealyBucket           # Leaky Bucket Algorithm simulation for traffic shaping
├───Stop and wait         # Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol simulation
├───TCP                   # TCP flow control, handshaking, and error control simulations
└───UDP                   # UDP communication logic
```

## 💻 Language Used

- **Java** (`.java` files)
- Java 8+ compatible

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Data Link Layer protocols (Bit/Byte Stuffing, CRC)
- Network Layer algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Distance Vector)
- Transport Layer protocols (TCP, UDP, Stop-and-Wait)
- Traffic shaping and congestion control (Leaky Bucket)
- Command simulations relevant to networking

## 🛠 How to Run

Navigate to the folder of interest and run the Java files:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Each file is self-contained and includes relevant comments or explanations.
