SQL Queries - 3 (day 17)

Consider following 3 tables
Sailors 
----------
sid 
sname
age
rating

Reserves
----------
sid
bid
date

Boats
----------
bid 
bname
colour

Write sql queries to retrieve data for following problems
Note:If we can solve a query using join and sub query try both versions
Q)Find names of sailors who have reserved boat 1 or 3
-- Using JOIN
SELECT DISTINCT s.sname
FROM Sailors s
JOIN Reserves r ON s.sid = r.sid
WHERE r.bid IN (1, 3);

-- Using Subquery
SELECT sname 
FROM Sailors 
WHERE sid IN (SELECT sid FROM Reserves WHERE bid IN (1, 3));

Q)Find name of sailors who have reserved a red boat
-- Using JOIN
SELECT DISTINCT s.sname
FROM Sailors s
JOIN Reserves r ON s.sid = r.sid
JOIN Boats b ON r.bid = b.bid
WHERE b.colour = 'red';

-- Using Subquery
SELECT sname 
FROM Sailors

FROM Sailors 
GROUP BY rating
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;



Consider above table emp 
id- prim key
Q) write sql query to swap all f to m and vive versa with a single update statement no intermediate temporary tables 
NOTE : do not write any select statement for this solution
